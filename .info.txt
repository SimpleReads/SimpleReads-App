COLOURS:

Colours are defined in tailwind.config.js. 

Syntactically, throughout the codebase colours are referred to as "[gray OR purple]-[multiple of 100]"; 
these refer back to the hex codes as they are defined in tailwind.config.js. 'Gray' is grayscale,
'purple' is anything in cyan - there is no way in hell I can be fucked going through the entire front-end
codebase correcting that.

COLOUR CONTRAST GUIDELINES:

According to the WCAG AAA standards for web accessability, text must have a contrast ratio of at least
7:1 with its background. Additionally, for the sake of Aphasia patients we are specifically using 
dark text on light backgrounds. As such, with the current colour palette, the following are valid
colour combinations for text:

TEXT COLOUR    |    GRAY BG          |    CYAN BG
---------------|---------------------|-------------------
gray-900       |    gray-[<= 400]    |    purple-[<= 600]
gray-800       |    gray-[<= 300]    |    purple-[<= 600]
gray-700       |    gray-[<= 200]    |    purple-[<= 600]
purple-900     |    gray-100         |    purple-[<= 200]
